* While implementing searchTrip with three parameters, its cyclomatic complexity was beyond 50 because of many conditional branches.
* Solution :
* Setting empty values in arguments to wildcard in regular expression can remove long if-else statements
* In addition, with the power of Java 8, stream().filter() helps me to reduce the cyclomatic complexity.

* While implementing Validator, by the nature of validation, I thought that there must be many if-else statements in one method. Consequently, it had high cyclomatic complexity.
* Solution :
* I splited a long `isValid` method into many small methods returning true or false and
* in `isValid`, I make it return the value of AND logical operator of all values of small methods.
